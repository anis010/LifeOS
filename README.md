# LifeOS

LifeOS is a concept for a unified personal operating system that blends health, finance, career, spirituality, and habits into a single experience. The repository contains static prototypes used to explore the product vision.

## Getting Started

Open `public/index.html` in your browser to explore the landing page. The other HTML files in the `public` directory provide deep dives into the product vision, features, and community experience.

## Development Notes

- All shared imagery lives in `public/assets/images` so that relative paths remain consistent across pages and scripts.
- Shared scripts belong in `public/scripts` to keep page markup clean and reusable.
- Planning and design documents are stored under `docs/` to separate them from production assets.
